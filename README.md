# Botwars
Botwars is an MMOTBS (Masive Multiplayer Online Turn Based Stratagy). In this game you control pawns using a JSON API. The pawns may mine and collect resources, build buildings, attack, and move around.

The idea is to have all pawns programaticaly controlled by programs running on a players computer. A player could have more than one program running. 
It is possible to write a client that is directly controlled by a human. I am not opposed to this, but I think it would be less powerful than the other alternatives (would be intresting to find out).

This project is still in development and is currently in a pre-alpha state. The following features are missing:
* Saving Server state
* Random Starting Posisions
* Terrain Generation
* Other language support
* A Public Server
